# dncCG-Disassembly
This toolkit provides an automated workflow for studying protein thermal disassembly using CafeMol molecular dynamics. The system combines coarse-grained simulations with all-atom contact analysis to accurately determine subunit disassembly orders.

## Key features:
- Iterative temperature sampling algorithm
- Hybrid coarse-grained/all-atom analysis
- Parallel execution across multiple nodes
- Automatic disassembly temperature detection
- Network visualization of disassembly patterns
